**Event storming lessons we learned:** A nice diverse group of people consisting of leadership/management, developers & IT, UX & product folks, etc. works best. Avoid event storming remotely if at all possible. Nothing beats a wall with sticky notes with people in front of it talking to each other. It's human, it's storytelling, it's tactile. It's what you want. Trying to event storm with only technicians in the room misses the point - event storming is a tool to make sure everybody with a stake in the outcome shares an understanding of what the system does.
