# The Human Eventstorming
___

## Why?

- Great for exploring large complex systems.
- Takes only a couple of hours.
- Less crossed wires.
- Less meetings, less &#34;documentation&#34;.
- Shared understanding, understood by all.
- Fun!

## How to Event Storm

![Adaptech Logo](/images/eventstorming-eventstormed.png)

___

#### https://webeventstorming.com

&lt;iframe width=&#34;1120&#34; height=&#34;720&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Pb4a8lr74E&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Note: &#34;EMD (Event Markup Language) is a simple text notation for event storming online. We also use it to generate APIs for the Adaptech Platform. Basically, any line with a -&gt; is a command. Anything with a * is a document. Everything else is an event.&#34;

# Bike From Mike
**Envelope 1**
![bike](/images/bike.png)

Note: 
1. &#34;Take a look at these requirements and do an event storming.&#34;

2. &#34;That&#39;s the &#39;happy path&#39;. Now ... spend two minutes on a second event stream which shows what happens when (deletion, etc.)&#34;

## Recipe Reviews

**Envelope 2**

What’s tasty? This site is about ranking recipes - enter yours and watch the number of stars go up. Should your creation be “Culinary Star Of The Month” by gaining the most 5 star ratings you get a $500 gift certificate.

Let’s make a site where aspiring and seasoned chefs can enter their recipies. We do need their email address to tell them if they won and they want to be able to edit and delete their creations. Site visitors are able to assign 1 to 5 stars and add comments.

Note: &#34;Take two minutes: Read the requirements. Then take a look at the events in the envelope. Try to arrange them in the right order.&#34; Participants will run into difficulties putting the technical events in sequence and will start discussing implementation details. &#34;That was painful. Try something else: Remove the technical events and try now.&#34;

___
# No Tech Jargon

* Ubiquitous Domain Language - practice it!
* Events are &#34;timeless&#34;, surviving technology fads &amp; obsolescence.

&gt; If we re-built it on a different stack - would this spec still apply?&#34;

# Kanban Board

- TODO
- Doing
- Done

Note: 
&#34;Using the Post-Its on the tables, event storm a simple Kanban board.&#34;
After 5 minutes, show the [Kanban board example](https://sites.google.com/adaptechsolutions.ca/workshop/kanban-board)

___

# Context Mapping Restaurant Kanban

How do these  map to the Kanban board TODO/Doing/Done?

```
# Kitchen
Order Received
Order Started
Order Plated
```

Note:
1. Discuss for 1 minute: How would the events for the kitchen be mapped to the events on the Kanban board? 
1. Ask a table group to present what they found.
1. Show other examples which could be mapped to a TODO list in this way, then give table groups two minutes to come up with their own examples.

```
Bug Found
Bug Assigned
Bug Fixed
```

Note:
&#34;Copy the EMD into webeventstorming.com. Then group commands and events which belong together. Put a comment for the name of the bounded context. WRITE DOWN THE EVENTS FOR LATER. Note: Documents can belong to more than one context!&#34; (5 minutes)

# Team Coordination Heroes
![heroine](/images/heroine-300px.png)

Note: &#34;You too can be team coordination heroes!&#34;
___
## Delivering The Online Ordering Product

#### COORDINATE THIS:

1. (Legacy) Inventory Management System Team
1. (Legacy) User Registration / Identity &amp; Access Team
1. Product Catalog CMS Team
1. Online Ordering / Shopping Experience Team
1. Payment Processing Team
1. Order Fulfillment System Team (... where  Order Placed events go ...)

Note:
Make every table a &#34;team&#34;. Have them spend one minute discussing which teams they need to coordinate with.
Then have &#34;meetings&#34; with other teams: Hand them a Post-IT with the name of the event they will receive from you.

# Hands-On

![manwithhammer](/images/man-with-hammer-300px.png)

___

# Koennen Vor Lachen

## THIS IS VERY ALPHA

1. Install NodeJS (... or Go)
2. Install https://eventstore.org/
3. Paste EMD into https://sites.google.com/adaptechsolutions.ca/workshop/esp-builder (Use one of the shopping cart bounded contexts.)
4. Generate NodeJS or Golang code
5. Ask us to come by and show you how to run it. 

___ 

## EMD conventions for the ESP Platform

- First comment is the name of the bounded context: **# Inventory**
- First word in event name is the event stream/aggregate: **Inventory Item** Created
- Aggregate name &#43; &#34;Id&#34; event property is the aggregate ID: Inventory Item Stocked // **inventoryitemId**, quantity, dateReceived

___

# What Business Rules Does It Need?

# Build A Read Model

Note:
&#34;As a team, decide on a business rule and a read model you&#39;d like to implement for your bounded context.&#34;
