This can be used for explaining project phases.

## Phase 1:

There are three columns:

- TODO
- Doing 
- Done

Tasks appear in "TODO". When somebody starts working on the task it goes to "Doing". When it's done ... it's "Done". 

## Phase 2:

The march of progress is not inexorable.

- It's possible to move from "Doing" back to "TODO".
- Things can become undone. (From "Done" to "TODO".)
- It's possible to delete tasks anytime, at any stage of completion.


## Phase 3:

- Custom columns! Instead of (or in addition to) TODO/Doing/Done, create your own.
- Prioritization! Re-arrange tasks so the most important ones are at the top.
