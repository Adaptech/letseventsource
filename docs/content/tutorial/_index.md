# Prototyping Event Sourced Microservices with LES

This tutorial shows how to use the ```les``` and ```les-node``` tools to build a NodeJS based event sourced microservice straight from an event storming. ```les``` and ```les-node``` are part of the LESTER stack ("Let's Event Source Together"). LESTER takes a specification for an event sourced system and produces deployment-ready commands, events, documentation and infrastructure. It is designed to make prototyping and starting implementation of an event based system simple and keep development efforts closely aligned with business objectives and requirements.
